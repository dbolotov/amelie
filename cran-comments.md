## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a link to the specific video where the algorithm is presented.

* Added a doi reference to a paper where the algorithm is described.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Elaborated on the algorithm in the DESCRIPTION.

* Added a sentence on where the algorithm is presented. I am not able
to find a published reference for this specific algorithm. The idea is 
described in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera here: 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning. This package includes a vignette
that details the algorithm.
