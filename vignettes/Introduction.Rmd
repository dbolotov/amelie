### Introduction

This vignette describes the anomaly detection algorithm and provides some examples.


### Description

This is a binary classification problem

Given an observation $x$ consisting of features $\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$, compute the probability density $p(x)$ of the features. If the $p(x) < \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a tuned parameter, flag the observation as anomalous.

### Concepts

#### Normal (Gaussian) distribution

This algorithm assumes that each of the features $x_i$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$: $x_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$. 

For a variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, the probability density of the normal distribution is given by: 

$$p(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
	

#### Parameter estimation

The normal distribution is parametrized by mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For a data set $\{x_1,x_2, ..., x_m\}$, the parameters are estimated using the following:

$$\mu = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i$$
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i-\mu)^2$$


#### Density estimation

The joint probability is calculated under the assumptions that features are independent of each other, and each feature is normally distributed. For a set of observations $\{x_1,x_2, ..., x_m\}$ where each observation $x_i \in R^n$: 

$$p(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{n}p(x_j;\mu_j,\sigma_j^2)$$

### Algorithm

Using the above assumptions and definitions, the algorithm is implemented as follows:

1. Given a data set $(x,y)$, split it into training and cross validation sets, $\{x^{(1)},...,x^{(m)}\}$ and $\{(x_{cv}^{(1)},y_{cv}^{(1)}), ..., (x_{cv}^{(k)},y_{cv}^{(k)})\}$.
    - Training set is not required to have any positive (anomalous) examples.
    - It is also a good idea to set aside a test data set for final evaluation.
2. Fit model $p(x)_{train}$ on training set.
    a. Fit parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for each feature.
    b. Calculate $p(x)_{train}$ for each row in train set.
3. Tune $\epsilon$ on cross-validation data set.
    a. Pick starting value for $\epsilon$.
    b. Calculate $p(x)_{cv}$ for each row in CV set using $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ from `step 2`.
    c. For each row $i$ in CV set, predict $y = 1$ if $p(x_i) < \epsilon$ (anomaly), else predict $y=0$.
    d. Evaluate prediction accuracy on CV set using F1 score.
    e. Update $\epsilon$ if F1 score improves. 
    f. Stop when best $\epsilon$ value is found.
4. Evaluate algorithm accuracy on the training set.
    - Use $p(x)_{train}$ from `step 2` and $\epsilon$ from `step 3`.
5. After training, evaluate algorithm accuracy on a separate test set.
    - Compute $p(x_i)_{test}$ using $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ from `step 2` and $\epsilon$ from `step 3`.
